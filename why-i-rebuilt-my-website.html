<h1>Why I Rebuilt My Website</h1>
<p>Posted on <em>Monday 21st August 2017</em></p>
<h1>Why Rebuild It?</h1>
<p>The older website was becoming stale and had a few bugs which I did not really have the time to address, and was relying on a more complex software stack than it really needed, so when I did have time to look at this site, I decided a rewrite was in order.</p>
<h3>What was the Goal with the Rewrite</h3>
<ul>
<li>To speed up the site</li>
<li>Make it easier to Maintain</li>
<li>Learn a framework rather than code everything myself</li>
</ul>
<p>The above goals were all met by simply using a decent framework.</p>
<h3>A Framework</h3>
<p>I decided that <strong>using a framework</strong> would be the most important point, more for the fact that I work with lots of different code on a daily basis, that having varying custom code in my own projects made it harder to maintain.</p>
<p>In another article I will go through my search for my idea framework.</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to use <a href="http://www.php.gt">phpGT</a> as it has a low learning curve and generally gets out of the way. Favoring the idea that php drops in when needed.</p>
<h4>The Benefits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Increased page load due to framework only getting involved when needed</li>
<li>Using the same framework for multiple projects makes maintenance easier</li>
</ul>
<h1>Anything New?</h1>
<h2>New Blog</h2>
<p>The last version of this website was the only one to not contain a blog, this was purely due to the previous sites blog being buggy. At the time not much was done on the site so it was removed. In this version though, I have opted for a different format.</p>
<p>Rather than having a blog powered by a MySQL Database, the one on this version of the website uses the filesystem to load and manipulate <strong>markdown</strong> files. This has been combined with the routing of the framework to make a resilient yet simple blogging platform.</p>

			searchBox.addEventListener("keyup", function(){
			let articles = document.querySelectorAll(".article");
				for (var i = 0; i < articles.length; i++) {
				    let current = articles[i]; 
				    let title = current.querySelectorAll("a")[0].innerHTML;  
				    let haystack = title.toLowerCase();
				    let needle = this.value.toLowerCase();
				    if(haystack.includes(needle)) {
				      current.classList.remove('hide');
				    }
				    else {
				      current.classList.add('hide');
				    } 
				}
			});
