Releasing a small update to the portfolio in the form of a search.

--PAGE--

For a couple of weeks now I have been checking back for certain articles on this blog just to recap some of the knowledge, such as using the mysql export and import commands.

I end up manually going through the list and usually going a page too far, so since I have had some time this morning I decided to add a crude but effective search.
Currently it only supports Article Title searching, but at the top of the articles list page you will find the search box, so have a play with it.

In future I intent on ugrading a little further to support using tags and categories, but this will be added when needed.
