Amazon has Broken Alexa, or at least the App.
With recent updates, Alexa has managed to cripple the Alexa Experience for many of its loyal customers.

Yesterday I noticed that my Echo Dot had lost its wifi connection, with the horrid red ring and alexa politely stating she cannot connect to the internet.

Today I decided to resolve the issue and assumed I just needed to pop into the setup mode and update the credentials. Easier said and done.

I had not realised the Alexa app on my phone had been recently updated, and apart from a nice UI, it is rubbish. To the point it has introduced game breaking bugs.

The bug for me is that when entering setup mode, and connecting to the Echo dots internal wifi network, the app stays on the same screen and prevents any changes being made.

So for the meantime, my Alexa Echo Dot is a paperweight, thanks Amazon.
