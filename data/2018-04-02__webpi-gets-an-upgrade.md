# WebPi Blog
As part of an upgrade to the WebPi website, I decided to add a simple blog based of the one I frequently use on my personal website https://www.chris-shaw.com. To save the extra work and to keep better track of my blogging content, I have set the WebPi Blog to work in replication.

# What is Replication
Rather than maintaining two blogs, I will maintain my personal blog with new categories. Articles within the weppi category will be automatically replicated here and kept current with my personal blog.

# Whats will the blog be for
- Annoucements Regarding WebPi
- Release Notes
- WebPi Tutorials

In short, anything WebPi Related.

# Lazy Developer?
The place I feel comfortable blogging is on my portfolio, its where I keep and show off what I can do. It is also somewhere I frequent daily. Now the WebPi Website was meant more as a splash page, So to keep it up to date and to keep using my portfolio, I have opted for a replication scenario.

It also gives me more free time for working on the code rather than the content.
